# Passw*rd Generator
This is the safest (the method of algorithm) password generator using crypto's random value instead of `Math.random()` as used by majority of services.

> Providing with the great UI and completely open source.

Don't worry, we will never save the passwords we generate nor store what you copy. The whole project is open sourced 🎊
